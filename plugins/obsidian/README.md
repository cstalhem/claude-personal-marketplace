# Obsidian Plugin

## About
This plugin defines the command and skill prompts used to automate tasks inside the Obsidian vault, such as generating daily notes or scaffolding new notes with consistent structure.

## Commands
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `process-meeting` | Placeholder for processing meeting notes; currently no command instructions are defined. |
| `today` | Generates a daily summary note in `dailies/` with meetings, tasks, and daily notes sections. |

## TODO
- Flesh out the `process-meeting` command with a full workflow for summarizing meetings and capturing action items.
- Add more daily note automation, such as tagging rules or automatic links to related notes.
- Document and expand available skills beyond `new-note` to cover common vault workflows.
