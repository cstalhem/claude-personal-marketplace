description: Process a meeting transcript into structured notes
---

When asked by the user, take the available meeting notes or transcript and turn it into a structured meeting note.

The note should follow this structure and align with any available meeting note templates in the vault:

Front matter:
  - Tags: list of relevant tags for the meeting (remove `unprocessed` if present)
  - Participants: list of participant names if available

Focus on concise, searchable bullets in each section defined by the relevant template. If the transcript or notes include action items, capture them as tasks with clear owners or due dates when possible.
