description: Process a meeting transcript into structured notes
---

## Background context

- Check the templates for a meeting note template.
- Check for actively used tags
- Check the location of the meeting notes for information on the client and project

## Instructions

When asked by the user, take the available meeting notes or transcript (depending on what is available in the note) and turn it into a structured meeting note.

- The structure should follow the meeting notes template.
- Front matter:
  - Tags: list of relevant tags for the meeting (remove `unprocessed` if present)
  - Participants: list of participant names if available. Ignore rooms or other non-people.
- Focus on concise, searchable bullets in each section defined by the relevant template.
- If the transcript or notes include action items, capture them as tasks with clear owners or due dates when possible.
- Separate on on-topic discussions from off-topic ones
